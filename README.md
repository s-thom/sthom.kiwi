# My website

I've written a new one again. It won't be the last.

The background is rendered using [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber), and caused me a lot of pain for the small and cheesy visual effect.

The code's all here, have a peek around. Suggest ideas if you'd like.
